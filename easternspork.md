# Mini Biped  

## Summary  

I will build a miniature bipedal / humanoid robot using servos. I'm hoping to make it walk and talk but let's see how it goes. I’ve been wanting to build a legged robot for a while now, but I’ve never really haven’t gotten to one because of the cost and time, but thanks to this, I won’t really have to worry about the money, and I’ll have the winter break to design the prototype!

I've done some torque calculations to make sure that the servos I'm getting would be adequate for the load on the joints - they should be a good rough estimate. I'll use the Ender 3 3D Printer I have, nuts and bolts, servo controllers, tools, and wires I have at hand as well outside of the items on the budget provided.  

Other methods of actuation, like DC Motor + Encoder have been considered, but they seem like a pain to integrate, use, and tune in a project like this - not to mention there's much less examples of that among hobbyists. (Which typically would make it more interesting but I don't want to spend too much time on this project and having examples helps a lot.) That'll probably be something I'll mess with in a second version in the future, so to maximize my budget I added them to my bill of materials.  

## Plan  

The steps to completion are as follows:  

1. After parts have arrived, test all electronic components to see if they are working correctly.
2. CAD basic leg prototype to be 3D printed.
3. 3D print prototype.
4. Assemble, set up wiring between components.
5. Write code to test, test leg on testing rig.
6. Refractor, improve code as needed.
7. Rinse and repeat 2-6 until satisfactory.
8. CAD the rest of the robot, 3D Print, Assemble, Wire
9. Write some more code to test basic functionality, keep iterating on design and code until satisfactory.
10. Write code for various tasks - standing, walking, etc.
11. Code the LCD to make the robot more interactive and cooler.
12. Minor adjustments etc.
13. Complete!! (for now)

## Budget

I plan on buying all of my products from Amazon because they ship quick and are relatively inexpensive, especially because the parts I plan on buying are pretty common.
